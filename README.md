## Setup

Open the `index.html` file on your browser to run the application.

Write your code in the `src/index.js` file.

## Deliverable

As a user, I can:

- See all of the burger names in a `div` with the id of `restaurant-menu`. Create a `span` tag with the name of the burger and add it to the `div#restaurant-menu`. The burger names are provided in an array stored in a variable named `burgerNames`.
